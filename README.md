## Description

Introducing our new web application designed to make healthy eating easy and convenient. With GreenUP, you can easily search for nutrition facts on a variety of greens and other healthy foods.

Whether you're looking to improve your overall health or simply want to make smarter food choices, our web application has everything you need to get started on your journey to better health.

## How to Use

are considering purchasing, simply click add to cart and continue browsing until you are ready to complete your order.
